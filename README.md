###Answers:
1.From the bar and pie charts, it is observed that the admission types are categorized as Elective, Emergency, and Urgent.
Both male and female patients are admitted under all categories with nearly equal proportions, as shown in the “Sum of Age by Admission Type and Gender” chart. The “Sum of Age by Admission Type” pie chart shows that each admission type—Elective, Emergency, and Urgen.

2.The “Sum of Age by Blood Type and Name” chart illustrates that individuals are distributed across various blood groups (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-).
Most names are grouped around A+, B+, and O+, which are the most common blood types. Age values in the inner circle show a wide spread, meaning all age groups have representation in these blood categories. Therefore, blood type categorization is not limited to a particular age group — it is evenly distributed.

3.From the “Count of Admission Type by Age” bar chart, emergency cases are spread across all age ranges, with slightly higher counts among the middle-aged group (around 30–60 years).
This suggests that emergency admissions are more common among working-age individuals, possibly due to health stress or accidents.

4.The “Count of Age by Medication” chart indicates that medications such as Antibiotics, Painkillers, Paracetamol, Prednisone, and Lipitor are given across all age groups in nearly equal quantities.
There is no major variation by age, which implies that these medications are used broadly for common medical conditions affecting all ages.

5.The “Sum of Age by Gender and Medical Condition” chart shows that both males and females are affected by conditions such as Arthritis, Asthma, and Cancer.
The values are nearly similar across genders, indicating that these diseases are not heavily gender-biased. However, there is a slightly higher sum of ages for females, possibly indicating either higher cases or longer treatment durations among women.
